# Decisions

## Fixes to the kit (from FIXES.md, Prompt 00)
1. Hero = PhasePath (7 isometric steps climbing Phase 1 → 7, one shape per phase). Ignore any "IsoLayerStack" / "7 layers" mention.
2. Fonts exactly: Archivo (display AND body), Instrument Serif Italic (one accent word per headline), IBM Plex Mono (labels, captions, metrics, HUD). Never IBM Plex Sans, Inter or a system stack. Load with next/font/google.
3. design/landing/landing.html uses local CSS variables; rebuild it with the variables from design/tokens.json / tokens.css.
4. Only the Paper landing is drawn. Build Blueprint (dark) from the [data-theme="blueprint"] tokens: same layout, chalk on navy.
5. Today, Lesson, Simulator, Studio, Interview, Dashboard are not drawn: compose them from design/components/* and design/notes.md.
6. If design/notes.md and design/design-system.md disagree, notes.md wins.
7. Lesson pages: no drafting grid, crosshairs or heavy motion behind reading text.

## Prompt 01
- Next.js 16.4 (latest stable). `cacheComponents` is off: all content is static files, so the simpler caching model is enough.
- pnpm pinned to 10.24.0 via `packageManager` (corepack's pnpm 12 cache on this machine is broken). Use Node 22.
- shadcn/ui is the Base UI flavour (`base-nova`); its semantic CSS variables are mapped onto the Field Manual tokens in `app/globals.css`, radius capped at 4px.
- `design/components.css` and the landing styles are copied into `app/styles/` inside `@layer components`, so Tailwind utilities can override them. Values unchanged.
- PhasePath and the landing simulator preview use the approved SVG geometry from `design/landing/landing.html` (generated into `*-markup.ts`). Hover readouts, rise and draw-in motion are CSS from components.css.
- Theme choice is stored in localStorage (`sdl-theme`) and applied by an inline script before paint. It moves to the Dexie Settings table in Prompt 03 only if needed.
- The landing page keeps its own header (as drawn); every other route uses the app shell via the `app/(shell)` route group.
- Sidebar tree shows the 7 phases; sections come from content in Prompt 02 (empty phases say "Coming soon"). No placeholder section names.

## Prompt 02
- MDX via `next-mdx-remote/rsc` with `blockJS: false` (lessons are trusted repo files; props like `items={[...]}` need JS expressions).
- Search uses MiniSearch. The index is built at build time into the static route `/search-index.json` and loaded in the browser on first query. That route also runs cross-file validation, so bad content fails `pnpm build`.
- Content validation errors name the file and field path (`lib/content/parse.ts`). `lib/content/content.test.ts` also enforces the §7 volume targets for every section.
- `<Term>` tooltips are pure CSS (hover and keyboard focus), linking to `/glossary#slug`.
- Shiki renders both github-light and github-dark colours; CSS picks one per `data-theme`.
- `/phase/[n]` lists a phase's sections (the collapsed sidebar links there).
